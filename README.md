### This is my repo for STATS 220. 

**A little about me:**

- I am undertaking a degree in CompSci and Statistics.
- I am taking STATS 220 because enjoy learning about statistics and its various applications, specifically predicting events.  
- I am interested in learning about web-scraping and making visual representations of gathered data.

*Some of my hobbies include:*
1. Making video game assets
2. Watching movies
3. Robotics

I learned a lot of what I know for programming and robotics from the following links:
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
* [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/@Brackeys)
* [International Robotics Academy](https://www.ira.edu.jo/)
