## Graffiti Related Observations in Auckland

This report explores graffiti data collected by me during the end of March. It focuses on location, political expression, and artistic quality.

```{r}
logged_data <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR3wRSXmfj4ZecJsF6nPZfs6jE0x4MH024DLqj8t5v-7F26H-cvmeXkn3PojNJbP5yK2tTs3StNelPe/pub?output=csv")

latest_data <- rename(logged_data,
  ObservationTime = `When did you observe the graffiti?`,
  ObservationLocation = `Where did you observe the graffiti?`,
  ColorCount = `How many colors were used?`,
  PoliticalNature = `Was the graffiti political in nature?`,
  ArtisticQuality = `How would you describe the artistic quality of the graffiti on a scale from 1 to 10?`,
  Condition = `Describe the condition of the graffiti`
)
```

Below we calculate two summary values from the dataframe: the lowest number of colors used in a graffiti piece, and the highest rating for artistic quality.

```{r}
min_color <- min(latest_data$ColorCount, na.rm = TRUE)
max_quality <- max(latest_data$ArtisticQuality, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The most simple graffiti piece used only `r min_color` colors, while the most artistically rated one scored `r max_quality` out of 10.

---

Now we look at how often graffiti was reported across different Auckland locations.

```{r}
ggplot(data = latest_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = ObservationLocation), fill = "#2b8cbe") +
  labs(
    title = "Graffiti Observations by Location",
    subtitle = "Frequency of graffiti sightings across different Auckland areas",
    x = "Location",
    y = "Number of Reports",
    caption = "Source: STATS220 Google Form Data"
  )
```

This bar chart shows which areas had the most frequent graffiti sightings, according to student observations.

---

Next, we examine whether the graffiti was reported as political in nature.

```{r}
ggplot(data = latest_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = PoliticalNature), fill = "#d95f0e") +
  labs(
    title = "Political Content in Graffiti",
    subtitle = "Breakdown of whether graffiti had political themes",
    x = "Political in Nature",
    y = "Number of Observations",
    caption = "STATS220 Google Form Data"
  )
```

As shown above, most graffiti pieces were non-political, though some did express political ideas.
